						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language.
						It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once,
						run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support
						Java without the need for recompilation.Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode 
						that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) 
						regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
