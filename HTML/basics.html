                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) 
                        and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. 
                        The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, 
                        and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. 
                        As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, 
                        Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. 
                        Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, 
                        however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open source software and 
                        used by most developers and 
                        is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. 
                        Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time. 
                        The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. 
                        Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia. 
                        Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996. 
                        It promised Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) functionality, providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. 
                        Fairly secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. 
                        Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages, 
                        and Java quickly became popular. The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly 
                        with the Java 1.0 language specification. With the advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 â€“ 1999), 
                        new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms. 
                        J2EE included technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server environments, 
                        while J2ME featured APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was renamed J2SE. 
                        In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE, Java ME, and Java SE, respectively.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards body 
                        and later the Ecma International to formalize Java, 
                        but it soon withdrew from the process. Java remains a de facto standard, controlled through the Java Community Process. 
                        At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge, 
                        despite their proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses 
                        for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.

                    JVM & Bytecode
                </h3>
                <article class="article">
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One design goal of Java is portability, which means that programs written for the Java platform 
                        must run similarly on any combination of hardware and operating system with adequate run time support. 
                        This is achieved by compiling the Java language code to an intermediate representation called Java bytecode, 
                        instead of directly to architecture-specific machine code. 
                        Java bytecode instructions are analogous to machine code, but they are intended to be executed 
                        by a virtual machine (VM) written specifically for the host hardware. 
                        End users commonly use a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on their machine for standalone Java applications, 
                        or in a web browser for Java applets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard libraries provide a generic way to access host-specific features such as graphics, threading, and networking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of universal bytecode makes porting simple. 
                        However, the overhead of interpreting bytecode into machine instructions made interpreted programs almost always run more slowly 
                        than native executables. Just-in-time (JIT) compilers that compile byte-codes to machine code during runtime 
                        were introduced from an early stage. Java itself is platform-independent and is adapted to the particular 
                        platform it is to run on by a Java virtual machine (JVM) for it, 
                        which translates the Java bytecode into the platform's machine language.

                    Syntax
                </h3>

                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The syntax of Java is largely influenced by C++ and C. Unlike C++, 
                        which combines the syntax for structured, generic, and object-oriented programming, 
                        Java was built almost exclusively as an object-oriented language. All code is written inside classes, 
                        and every data item is an object, with the exception of the primitive data types, 
                        (i.e. integers, floating-point numbers, boolean values, and characters), 
                        which are not objects for performance reasons. Java reuses some popular aspects of C++ (such as the printf method).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Java uses comments similar to those of C++. There are three different styles of comments: a single line style marked with two slashes (//), 
                        a multiple line style opened with /* and closed with */, 
                        and the Javadoc commenting style opened with /** and closed with */.

                        <p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2004, generics were added to the Java language, as part of J2SE 5.0. Prior to the introduction of generics, 
                            each variable declaration had to be of a specific type. For container classes, for example, 
                            this is a problem because there is no easy way to create a container that accepts only specific types of objects. 
                            Either the container operates on all subtypes of a class or interface, usually Object, or a different container class has to be 
                            created for each contained class. 
                            Generics allow compile-time type checking without having to create many container classes, each containing almost identical code. 
                            In addition to enabling more efficient code, 
                            certain runtime exceptions are prevented from occurring, 
                            by issuing compile-time errors. If Java prevented all runtime type errors (ClassCastExceptions) from occurring, 
                            it would be type safe.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Java applets were programs that were embedded in other applications, typically in a Web page displayed in a web browser. 
                            The Java applet API is now deprecated since Java 9 in 2017.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swing is a graphical user interface library for the Java SE platform. 
                            It is possible to specify a different look and feel through the pluggable look and feel system of Swing. Clones of Windows, 
                            GTK+, and Motif are supplied by Sun. Apple also provides an Aqua look and feel for macOS. Where prior implementations of these 
                            looks and feels may have been considered lacking, 
                            Swing in Java SE 6 addresses this problem by using more native GUI widget drawing routines of the underlying platforms.

                            but since JDK 11 JavaFX has not been in the core JDK and instead in a separate module. 
                            JavaFX has support for desktop computers and web browsers on Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS. 
                            JavaFX does not have support for native OS look and feels.

                        He created the original design of Java and implemented the language's original compiler and virtual machine.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is detailed by a specification that formally describes 
                        what is required in a JVM implementation. Having a specification ensures interoperability of Java programs across different implementations

                        It can also be used as a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it.
