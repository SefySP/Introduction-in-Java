                About Java
            </h2>
            <article class="article">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) 
                and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. 
                The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, 
                and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. 
                As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, 
                Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. 
                Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, 
                however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open source software and 
                used by most developers and 
                is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.

                History
            </h3>
            <article class="article">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. 
                Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time. 
                The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. 
                Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia. 
                Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar. 
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996. 
                It promised Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) functionality, providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. 
                Fairly secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. 
                Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages, 
                and Java quickly became popular. The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly 
                with the Java 1.0 language specification. With the advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 â€“ 1999), 
                new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms. 
                J2EE included technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server environments, 
                while J2ME featured APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was renamed J2SE. 
                In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE, Java ME, and Java SE, respectively.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards body 
                and later the Ecma International to formalize Java, 
                but it soon withdrew from the process. Java remains a de facto standard, controlled through the Java Community Process. 
                At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge, 
                despite their proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses 
                for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.

                JVM & Bytecode
            </h3>
            <article class="article">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One design goal of Java is portability, which means that programs written for the Java platform 
                must run similarly on any combination of hardware and operating system with adequate run time support. 
                This is achieved by compiling the Java language code to an intermediate representation called Java bytecode, 
                instead of directly to architecture-specific machine code. 
                Java bytecode instructions are analogous to machine code, but they are intended to be executed 
                by a virtual machine (VM) written specifically for the host hardware. 
                End users commonly use a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on their machine for standalone Java applications, 
                or in a web browser for Java applets.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard libraries provide a generic way to access host-specific features such as graphics, threading, and networking.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of universal bytecode makes porting simple. 
                However, the overhead of interpreting bytecode into machine instructions made interpreted programs almost always run more slowly 
                than native executables. Just-in-time (JIT) compilers that compile byte-codes to machine code during runtime 
                were introduced from an early stage. Java itself is platform-independent and is adapted to the particular 
                platform it is to run on by a Java virtual machine (JVM) for it, 
                which translates the Java bytecode into the platform's machine language.
